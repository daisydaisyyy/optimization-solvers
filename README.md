### optimization-solvers

Python scripts to solve optimization problems step by step, covering linear, integer, network, and non-linear programming.

**Linear Programming (LP):**
- Compute the initial basis for the simplex algorithm given a specific point
- Simplex algorithm, optimal solution
- Gomory cuts to find integer solutions

**Network Linear Programming:**
- Compute flow and potential given a T, L, U partition
- Simplex algorithm applied to capacitated networks
- Dijkstra (shortest path tree)
- Max-Flow / Min-Cut: find max flow and the corresponding min-cut

**Integer Linear Programming (ILP):**
- Knapsack problem
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Branch & Bound

**Non-Linear Programming (NLP):**
- Stationary points categorization
- Projected gradient method
- Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (KKT)

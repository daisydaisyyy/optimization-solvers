### optimization-solvers

Python scripts to solve optimization problems step by step, covering linear, integer, network, and non-linear programming.

**Linear Programming (LP):**
- Compute the starting basis for the Simplex algorithm from a given point
- Simplex algorithm
- Find optimal solution
- Generate Gomory cuts for integer solutions

**Network Linear Programming:**
- Compute flow and potential given a T, L, U partition
- Simplex algorithm on network problems
- Dijkstra (shortest path tree)
- Solve Max-Flow / Min-Cut problems using Ford-Fulkerson / Edmonds-Karp

**Integer Linear Programming (ILP):**
- Knapsack problem
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Branch & Bound method

**Non-Linear Programming (NLP):**
- Stationary points categorization
- Projected Gradient Method (PG)
- Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (KKT)
